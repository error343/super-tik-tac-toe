Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is a strategic twist on the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, played on a 9x9 grid that's divided into nine smaller 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe boards. Two players take turns placing Xs and Os, but
# RULES
there's a unique rule: the square you choose in a small board determines which of the nine boards your opponent must play in next. For example, if you place your symbol in the top-right square of a small board, your opponent's next move must be in the top-right board. Each small board can be won like a normal Tic-Tac-Toe game, and once it's won or full, it's considered "closed." The goal is to win three small boards in a row—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally—on the larger 3x3 meta-board. This game adds layers of strategy, as you have to think both locally and globally, planning moves ahead while trying to control where your opponent goes.
